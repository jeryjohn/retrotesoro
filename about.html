            <h2>Why Thrift?</h2>
            <p>Thrifting is not only about finding unique and timeless pieces—it’s also about supporting the environment. By choosing secondhand, you help reduce waste and lessen the demand for fast fashion, which has a large impact on our planet. Plus, every item has its own history, making your purchase one-of-a-kind!</p>
